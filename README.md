# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview

This project presents a Logistic Regression-based credit card fraud detection model that effectively mitigates financial risks by identifying fraudulent transactions. The model is developed using Python, with Pandas for data preprocessing and Sklearn for implementing the Logistic Regression algorithm.

## Key Features

- **Logistic Regression Model:** We employ a Logistic Regression algorithm, a powerful tool for binary classification, to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned and processed using Pandas to prepare it for machine learning. This step includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and more.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a credit card transaction dataset containing a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
